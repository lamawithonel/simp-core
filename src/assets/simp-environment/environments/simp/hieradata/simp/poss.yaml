# This is the empty SIMP scenario hiera file

# If you are beginning to use SIMP and don't want to include any clases by default,
# this is the scenario for you.
#
# SIMP catalysts defined in simp_options all default to `false` and are disabled
# by default, allowing you to set up your infrastructure as you need,
# piece by piece.
#
# See `manifests/site.pp` for an example use case for the $simp_scenario variable.

# Hiera crashes if there are empty files, so
# please remove the following line if you use this file
